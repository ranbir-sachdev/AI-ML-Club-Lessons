# 🧠 AI/ML Club Lesson 1: What is Generative AI, Machine Learning, and LLMs?

Welcome to the first lesson of our AI/ML Club! Today, we’re going to explore what **Generative AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **LLMs** (Large Language Models) are — in a fun and easy-to-understand way.

This session is meant to be **vague but intriguing**, so don’t worry if you don’t understand everything right away. Let’s just explore. 🌌

## 🌟 Topic 1: What is Generative AI?

Generative AI is a **type of artificial intelligence that creates something new** — like text, images, code, or music. It’s like a machine with imagination (sort of).

### 🔍 Try This!
**Think-Pair-Share:**  
- What’s something creative that you’ve seen AI do?  
- Share with your partner or group!

## 🤖 Topic 2: What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is the **process of teaching machines using data** instead of writing rules.

Imagine showing a computer **hundreds of pictures of cats and dogs**. Over time, it learns to tell them apart *without being told how to do it*.

### 🔍 Try This!
**Guess the Pattern:**  
We show 3 sequences of numbers. Can you guess the rule?

1. 2, 4, 6, 8, ?  
2. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ?  
3. 10, 9, 7, 4, ?  

➡️ Discuss what you think the next number is and why. That’s how a machine starts thinking too!

## 🧠 Topic 3: What are LLMs (Large Language Models)?

LLMs are **huge AI models trained on text from books, websites, and articles**. They can:
- Answer questions
- Write stories
- Help you with homework
- Even argue (a little too well sometimes 😅)

But remember — they **don’t actually understand** like we do. They just generate based on patterns.

### 🔍 Try This!
**LLM Prompt Challenge:**  
If you had to teach an AI to say “Hello” in the most polite way possible, what would you say?

➡️ Share your best prompt with the group!

## 🧩 Wrap-Up Challenge: Mystery Box

You are an AI trained only on food recipes.

Your prompt is:  
> “Write a poem about space...”

**What kind of response do you think you’d generate?**

Discuss with the group:  
- What parts might be accurate?  
- What might be totally weird?

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Generative AI creates new things.
- Machine Learning helps AI learn patterns from data.
- LLMs are massive AI models trained on text to talk like humans.

👀 Stay curious — we’re just getting started.
